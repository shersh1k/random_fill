## Description

One boring quarantine evening lazily leafing through memes came across the ![following picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shersh1k/random_fill/master/src/assets/rules.jpg)

which resulted in this game.
After I spent hours developing a more or less viable version, and after playing this version, I realized that the game is disastrously boring :(
But it didnâ€™t matter anymore :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production and deploy it to github-pages.<br />

P.S This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
